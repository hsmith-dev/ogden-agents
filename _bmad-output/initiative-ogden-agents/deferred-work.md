  summary: Confirm the 6-job CI matrix is green, including the Windows-only smoke, packaging and launcher paths.
  evidence: The user deferred pushing; it's settled by pushing the branch and seeing 6/6 jobs pass. If Windows fails, it's medium severity (the install proof is broken on one supported OS).

  summary: Enforce that a session event's workspaceId matches its session, by appending session events only through a core helper that derives workspaceId (epic 2).
  evidence: `EventLog.append` checks ID formats only; a mismatched workspaceId would be stored and survive `deleteWorkspaceHistory` of the session's real workspace. There is no caller today, so it's carried into epic 2's inception by the user's decision.

  summary: Replace the full-history replay on page load with per-workspace, windowed, paged subscriptions (epic 2).
  evidence: `subscribe(0)` delivers every retained event synchronously in one tick, and events are retained forever (AD-5), so the event loop and socket buffers grow with history. It's harmless at today's size and carried into epic 2's inception by the user's decision.
- source_plan: none
  summary: Rename note: entries above use the pre-rename paths (initiative-ogdenmad, spec-ogdenmad, architecture-ogdenmad); they now live under initiative-ogden-agents with *-ogden-agents names.
  evidence: The product was renamed OgdenMad to Ogden Agents on 2026-09-29; entries are append-only, so the old paths are left as written.

  summary: Move API and WebSocket auth from the loopback session cookie to a per-tab token (AD-15 amendment) before epic 2 exposes agent control.
  evidence: RFC 6265 cookies ignore ports, so `ogden_session_<port>` is sent to every web server on 127.0.0.1 and could be replayed by one with forged Host and Origin. Story 1.4 made the name port-specific and documented the limit, per the user's decision.
